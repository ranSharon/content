### App Overview
FakeBook - the app for fake news and posts

Requirements:
* Tabs: Feed tab, new/edit tab
* User is able to see/add/edit/delete posts
    * Add with a POST request
    * Edit with a PUT request
    * Delete with a DELETE request
* User can upload a single image with post
* Bonus: Add Server side validation for requests with body (POST/PUT) 
* Bonus: Add basic authentication - user need to log in in order to change the data

---
### Backend Repo: Static server + API
* Create a new [express project](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html)
```shell script
mkdir fakebook-server
cd server
npx express-generator --no-view --git 
```

* Edit the `package.json` and `.gitignore` as you like and then
```shell script
npm install
git init
```
* Convert to ES6: `var => const`
* Change Port number so it won't collide with react default
* install `nodemon`

---
### Backend Repo: Static server + API

* Make sure you can serve static file from the `public` folder
* On request to `\`, `public\index.html` should be loaded
* Data will be stored on a JSON file: `db.json`
* Additional (API) endpoint:
    - `\api\posts` - all posts
    - `\api\posts\:id` - a single post by id

---
### Frontend Repo: React 
* Create a new [react project](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
```shell script
npx create-react-app fakebook-client --typescript
```
* Add router with 3 routes: 
    - `\feed`  
    - `\create-post\`
    - `\edit-post\:id`
* On `\feed` load, preform a GET request to server `post` endpoint to get the items to render
* On `\create-post\` load an empty post form
* On `\edit-post\:id` load  post edit form

---
### Integration Check
* Read data from server
* Build client and serve static content from `public`

---
### Implement CRUD
* Read all post:  `GET \api\posts` 
* Read single post:  `GET \api\posts\:id` 
* Create post:  `POST \api\posts\` 
* Update post:  `PUT \api\posts\` 
* Delete post:  `DELETE \api\posts\` 
Find a safe way to determine new post id

---
### Save Images
* Save images to `images` directory on server
* Save image file name as part of the post data
* Serve images using endpoint `\images\:imageFileName`

---
### Data validation and basic authentication
* Validate data creation / update using [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi)
* Add basic authentication using [express-basic-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-basic-auth)

---
### Further reading
* See JOI section on [Build RESTful APIs with Node and Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48)

### HW
* Finish class practice
