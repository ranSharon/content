###  App Recap
What do we have so far?
* Tabs: Feed tab, new/edit tab
* User is able to see/add/edit/delete posts
    * Add with a POST request
    * Edit with a PUT request
    * Delete with a DELETE request
* Posts contain a text and an image
* Post text is validated on server for XSS prevention

### Work plan
1. Connecting MongoDB and create "fakebook" DB + "posts" collection
2. Add Mongoose to server side
3. Store textual data on DB (current JSON data)
4. Store images on DB
5. Bonus: use atlas to store data on the cloud 
6. Bonus2: deploy server code (including client) to Heroku
