### Requirements: Breaking it down
We'll need 3 things to make a PWA from a web-app:
* A Service worker
* Manifest file
* HTTPS connection

---

### Requirements: Breaking it down
[Service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/)
  * Work in the background
  * Can get updates periodically
  * Can get data for [push notifications](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/push-notifications/subscribing-a-user)
  * Can cache resources
  * Require HTTPS

### Requirements: Breaking it down

[manifest.json](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/) - describe the app:
  * App [short/ long name)](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/#name)
  * [Display](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/#display) mode and [icons](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/#icons)
  * Required to [install app banner](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/)
  * Theme and Splash screen

Remember to link (in `index.html`)
  * [manifest file](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/#tell_the_browser_about_your_manifest)
  * [icons](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37426977/added-icons-in-manifest-json-but-got-no-icon-in-splash-screen)
  * note you must have 192x192 and 512x512 icons in order to display installation banner
