* Live coding: [starting an expo project](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)
* Practice: creat an empty RN project (name: rn-tick-tac-toe)
  * Use **Blank with Typescript**
  * Name the app **Tick-Tac-Toe**
* Read [Hello World](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial#hello-world)

### [Getting started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)

Test your project can run on your smart-phone
* `Tunnel` option will work almost always
* Scan QR with expo - client

### [Getting started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)
Have you noticed that...
* Git is initialized but has no commits
* No `index` file (`App` is treated by expo)

---

### Building App with RN
Components and styling
* [Component](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/components-and-apis)
* Styling
  * [StyleSheet](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/style)
  * [From the Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/view.html#style)

### Building App with RN

Practice: tick-tac-toe from web to RN
* step 1: convert square component
* step 2: convert board component
* step 3: convert game component

---

### Building App with RN
step 1: convert square component

* [RN buttons](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/button)
> A basic button component that should render nicely on any platform. 
Supports a minimal level of customization... If this button doesn't look right for your app, you can build your own button using `TouchableOpacity` or `TouchableNativeFeedback`.

* [Customized buttons](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/touchableopacity)


---

### Building App with RN
* step 2: convert board component (set a static board)
* step 3: convert game component (add complete game logic)

---

### Wrapping Okat-Cupid

We can wrap a web-app with [react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview),
Building both web and mobile app with most of the code shared.

---

### Home Work:
* Finish class practice

### Extra
* Make your PlayBuzz a mobile app with [react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview)
