### Menu page

  * "Add" button will add item to order (Always enable)
  * "Remove" / "X" button will remove item from order
  * You can order same item multiple times
  * Checkout will change page to summary page
  * Small "Order" component will display current items in order

---

### Summary page
* Display all items in order 
* Display total price

### Suggested steps

1. Creat react app
2. Add redux
3. Create store and connect to App with Provider
4. Create basic actions and reducers
5. Create Menu page only
6. Connect Menu to store and interact with it
7. After Menu page works perfectly - add Summary and About pages

### Extra
* Save to localStorage on each step (in App component)
* On app load - load state from localStorage if exist
* On order clear -  clear localStorage
