* less/sass/scss etc
* [scss features](https://sass-lang.com/guide)

---

### [Building a Style-Kit / Style-Guide](https://designmodo.com/create-style-guides/)
* Create a kit and implement - Don't "style as you go"
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Set rules for repeating elements - buttons, cards, panels etc
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Rules should determine every setting which may change, like:
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - padding / margin
    - height / width
    - colors
    - fonts

---
### [Building a Style-Kit / Style-Guide](https://designmodo.com/create-style-guides/)
* Set well-determined color pallet - 2-8 colors should be enough
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Rules should include all "exceptional cases"
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->[BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/buttons/)

### Styling in React
Inline vs Css files
```
// Circle.css
.circle {
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
}
    
// Circle.js
import 'Circle.css'

const Todo: React.FC = () => {
  return (
      <div className="circle"></div>
  )
};
```

---
### Styling in React
Inline vs Css files
```ts
const Todo: React.FC = () => {
  const styles = {
    circle: {
      border-radius: '50%',
      height: '100px',
      width: '100px'
    }
  }

  return (
      <div style={styles.circle}></div>
  )
};
```

---
### Styling in React
Inline-Styling Pros:
* No styling collisions
* Encourage component thinking
* State-dependent changes are straightforward

Inline-Styling Cons:
* Can't use pseudo-selectors and media queries without external libraries
* Can't use css tools like pre-processing 
* No global styling
* Learning / adjustment time
