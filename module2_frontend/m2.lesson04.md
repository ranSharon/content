### Styling in React
Inline vs Css files
```
// Circle.css
.circle {
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
}
    
// Circle.js
import 'Circle.css'

const Todo: React.FC = () => {
  return (
      <div className="circle"></div>
  )
};
```

### Styling in React
Inline vs Css files
```ts
const Todo: React.FC = () => {
  const styles = {
    circle: {
      border-radius: '50%',
      height: '100px',
      width: '100px'
    }
  }

  return (
      <div style={styles.circle}></div>
  )
};
```

pros:
no styling collisions
encourage component thinking
state-dependent changes are straightforward

cons:
can't use pseudo-selectors and media queries without external libraries
global styling
require learning new technique
