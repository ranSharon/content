### Prep
* Finish reading
[Main concepts section](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html), items 7 - 12


### Agenda
1. Component Lifecycle
2. Conditional Rendering
3. Forms
4. Thinking in React - start trivia

---

### [Component Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class)
Component [mounting Order](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#mounting)
```
constructor()
static getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()
```


---

### [Component Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class)
In Class form we can use it like:
```
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {...}

  // start interval after mounting
  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(
      () => this.tick(),
      1000
    );
  }

  tick() {...}
  render() {...}
}
```

### [Component Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class)
Component [updating Order](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#updating)
(when component is being re-rendered)
```
static getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
componentDidUpdate()
```


---

Component [Unmounting](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#error-handling)
(when component is being removed from the DOM)
```
componentWillUnmount()
```

---

### [Component Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class)
[Error Handling](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#unmounting)
```
static getDerivedStateFromError()
componentDidCatch()
```

---

### [Component Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class)
Component [mounting Order](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#mounting)
(when an instance of a component is being created)
```
constructor()
static getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()
```


---

### [Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)
* [Element Variables]()
* [Inline If with Logical && Operator](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html#inline-if-with-logical--operator)
* [Inline If-Else with Conditional Operator](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html#inline-if-else-with-conditional-operator)
* [Preventing Component from Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html#preventing-component-from-rendering)

---

### Forms
Question: What's the problem with forms elements (input, textarea, and select) in React?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Answer: they already have some sort of "state"
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Example: when we type inside an input we change it's value
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Forms
There are two ways to treat this "internal state

* Force them to behave as we like using [Controlled Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components).
This is recommended for most cases, as it will make the React state the “single source of truth”.

* Keep the default behaviour - [Uncontrolled Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html).
(Which is easier).

---

### [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
* Read this section in the docs
* Practice time - build a trivia app

---

### [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
[A word about Inheritance (and composition)](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)

"At Facebook, we use React in thousands of components, and we haven’t
found any use cases where we would recommend creating
component inheritance hierarchies."
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
Trivia app requirements
* User see 1 question at a time
* Each question has 4 answers (Buttons)
* User get right/wrong indication
* Header shows number of correct/wrong answers
* When finished - show score summary + "Try again?" button

---

### [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
Instructions:
* Use the tip from the docs - [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
* Split components when required. Prefer using functional components
* Single responsibility principle,
* Style with css. You may use [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction)
* **App** (root) component should hold the questions data (and probably the user data as well)

---
### Home Work:
* Watch Dan Abramov's talk about [React Hooks (00:11:30 - 1:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM)
* Finish Trivia app at home

### Extra
* Add a server which hold the questions data (JSON) and fetch data from server
