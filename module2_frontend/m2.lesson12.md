### [Introducing Error Boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html#introducing-error-boundaries)
> Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed

---

### [Introducing Error Boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html#introducing-error-boundaries)
Error boundaries do not catch errors for:

* [Event handlers](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html#how-about-event-handlers)
* Asynchronous code (e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks)
* Server side rendering
* Errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children)

[TL;DR](https://www.google.com/search?q=tldr+meaning&oq=TLDR&aqs=chrome.1.0l6.2517j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
Error boundaries are meant for Components Creation / Update, not async / data-fetch events
