* store - manage your stuff

### Motivation for adding redux

* State management (Not only redux) help us managing app data 
and state without passing states/props all over.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* State management make app predictable.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Multiple Components may use the same data.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Multiple Components may use the same data.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Application state can be saved for later load.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
Redux considered as the industry standard as react state management.
