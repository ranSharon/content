### Code build intro & analysis
Code building: Generate a production-ready code

* Compilation (TS => ES5/6)
* [Minification and Comment removal](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19694448/whats-the-difference-between-concat-and-uglify-and-minify/19694522#19694522)
* [Uglification - short vars and func names](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19694448/whats-the-difference-between-concat-and-uglify-and-minify/19694522#19694522)
* [Tree Shaking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking)
* Bundling (Concatenation and splitting)
* [Source Mapping](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/#source-mapping)

---

### [Static File Caching](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/production-build#static-file-caching)

* filename hash - what it's good for?

* [Cache-Control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) header

* React - [Static File Caching](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/production-build#static-file-caching)

### Serving SPA
Practice:

run [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server#running-on-demand) 
on okat-cupid build. see if you have any errors using the app.
If you encounter errors - figure out what cause them (see the servers log)

Note: delete `homepage` from `package.json` before the build.

---

### Serving SPA
Use [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) on okat-cupid build. 
see if it solves the issue you've encounter.

```
npm run build
npx serve -s build
```

Question: Why do we use `-s` flag?

---

### Serving SPA
`serve --help`:
```
  -s, --single  Rewrite all not-found requests to `index.html`
```

This is used to solve the issue of using a static server with react-router. 

---

### Serving SPA
Question - why did we removed `homepage` from `package.json` before the build?

* [Answer](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment#building-for-relative-paths)
* Add `homepage` back, do `npm run build` and try using `serve` again. what's the difference?


---


### Deployment (gh-pages)

Practice - [build and deploy to github pages](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment#github-pages-https-pagesgithubcom)


* intro about static files and [public folder](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/using-the-public-folder)
* intro about [Environment vars](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables)
* [Advanced Configuration](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration)


---

### Further reading
* [concat, uglify, and minify](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19694448/whats-the-difference-between-concat-and-uglify-and-minify/19694522#19694522)
* [Caching best practices & max-age gotchas](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/) - without service worker

---

### Home Work:
* Read [Adding Images, Fonts, and Files](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files)
* Read [Using the Public Folder](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/using-the-public-folder)

### Extra
* Find an easy way to deploy `okat-cupid` to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). 
Hint:
```
// packag.json
"start": "serve -s",
"postinstall": "npm run build"
```
