### Home Work:
* Build Blog API server:
    - See [Routes section](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), click on the first 5 GET requests to see the JSON responses
    - Create a server which serve the first 5 request you've reviewed. response data should be identical.
    - You can download and use [Posts JSON](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and [Comments JSON](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments)

### Extra:
* Build API server - add support for 'search' parameter for posts. it will return data items which include the provided string in their name OR body properties.
```
   	/posts?search=dinosaur
```
