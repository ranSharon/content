### Libraries and Docs: Learning to learn

1. Get an overview
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

2. Perform very basic task. popular libraries usually provide a documented "Quick start"
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

3. Make sure you know what you are looking for ([duck-debug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) may help)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

4. Use google with keywords, general to specific (like: js, Handlebars, some task  / functionality)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Libraries and Docs: Learning to learn
Go to resources (here are some common results)
- Stack overflow - mostly specific and right to the point
- w3school - great for getting short and specific data
- MDN - very professional data, include reference for standard, specs, compatibility etc
- Item specific docs - React, JQuery, Lodash etc.
- Medium / Hacker noon etc. - Many posts / elaborated articles written mostly by professional
- github / npm - most likely will hold some docs or link to docs, and the source.

### Lodash: A JavaScript utility library
* ***Utility library*** provide functionality for common tasks
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* examples:  sorting, cloning, filtering, mapping  etc.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Lodash vs Underscore (vs Ramda vs whatever...) 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Lodash exist since 2012 - some of it's functionality already have [native support](https://github.com/you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need-Lodash-Underscore)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### [Lodash: A JavaScript utility library](https://lodash.com)
* Basic concept: pass data, then predicate (if needed/supported)
* Live demo
    - [sort](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#sortBy)
    - [clone](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#clone)
    - [filter](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#filter)
    - [map](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#map)
    - and many, many more

---

### Lodash: A JavaScript utility library - Practice
* Live Short Demo
* Use Lodash sort and filter your Blog API server (lesson 7 H.W.)
    - sorting: `/posts?sortBy=title`
    - filtering: `/posts?id=3&userId=1`
* Bonus: add text filter (search the body property). Note the spaces.
    - `/posts?bodyInclude="some text"`

### [Bootstrap: Mobile-first UI framework](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* Versions, Docs & breaking changes - latest is 4.3
* [Overview](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/)
* [Contents](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/contents/)

* Flexbox vs bootstrap grid vs [css grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) [2](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
* Practice - use bootstrap layout for Blog API client side.

### Bootstrap: Mobile-first UI framework - Practice
* Install bootstrap with CDN (css and js)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Use bootstrap basic components (buttons, panels etc.)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Add Navbar ("top-bar")
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Add "Unsupported on mobile devices" for screens smaller then *md*
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Handlebars: Template engine
What is a template engine?
```html
<div>
  <h1>{{title}}</h1>
  <div>
    {{body}}
  </div>
</div>
```
* a software designed to combine templates with a data model
* help to make data/view separation
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* no need for manual data injections as in native templates
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* intuitive (similar concept to DOM manipulation via html templates)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
