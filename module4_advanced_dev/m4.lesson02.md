---

### Prep
1. Create an account on heroku
2. Install Heroku CLI

### Agenda
1. Deployment
2. DevOps 
3. Deployment Environments
4. Letters and Meanings
5. CI/CD with Heruko
6. Let's talk CI

---
### Deployment
Practice - deploy using Heroku CLI
* create repo for a node server 
* Read about [process.env.PORT](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15693192/heroku-node-js-error-web-process-failed-to-bind-to-port-within-60-seconds-of)
* Follow [Heruko getting-started-with-nodejs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)
steps 1-5

---

### Deployment
Heroku provide different deployment options:
* Using Git + Heroku CLI
* Using Github integration
* Using Docker (New in Heroku)

A word about PaaS and IaaS

### DevOps

---
### DevOps
The process of Getting new Idea (new code) out to the world (production server).

DevOps Deals with connecting Development and Operation... what can be confederated as "Operation"?
* Everything between you and production: Build, Auto-Testing, QA etc. 
* Logs and Clients Feedback (Which prioritize task for next sprint)
* The goal: shorten development life cycle


---
### DevOps
DevOps should look for
- Re-work (deployment)
- Overhead (deployment complexity)



---

### [Deployment Environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment)
* ***Local*** - Developer's desktop/workstation
* ***Dev*** - Development server, where testing is performed by the developer
* ***QA*** -  where testing is performed by QA
* ***Stage*** - Pre-production, Mirror of production environment, display application to product team/roles before deployment
* ***Production/Live*** - Serves end-users/clients

### Letters and Meanings
* ***CI*** (Continuous Integration) - Automated process which integrate code on each change (Commit)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* ***CD*** (Continuous Delivery) - The Capability to deploy an Environment at any given time
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* ***CD*** (Continuous Deployment) - Automated process which deploy on each code change (Commit)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* ***ACDC*** (???)

### CI/CD with [Heruko](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)
Make sure to use [process.env.PORT](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15693192/heroku-node-js-error-web-process-failed-to-bind-to-port-within-60-seconds-of)

---
### CI/CD 
Auto Deploy from master 
* Create / Fork [simple node project](https://github.com/webbeast2019/hello-cicd-backend)
* Add auto deployment [connect to github](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration#automatic-deploys) (app dashboard > deploy > deployment methods)
* After connected to github repo, Enable Automatic deploys
* Test by merging a new PR

---
### CI/CD 
Add Production Environment and Delivery on demand
* add new pipeline (my-app-deployment)
* production >  add app... > create new app (my-app-production)
* For deploying staging app to production click "Promote"
* See "Activity" Tab
* Test by merging a new PR, followed by promoting manually to production

---
### CI/CD - Add review apps
* from pipeline view "enable review apps"
* add app.json and commit to repo
* enable "create new reviews ... Automatically"

---
### CI/CD 
Add frontend project
* Create / Fork [frontend project](https://github.com/webbeast2019/hello-cicd-frontend)
* Start the app. node local and production proxy configs
* Install express on frontend project, create simple static express server (don't forget process.env.PORT)
* Test your frontend server (build and serve)

---
### CI/CD 
Deploy frontend project
* Add a main entry in package.json
* npm start should point to server
* Add a postinstall entry in package.json
* Tip: remember to set the correct `homepage` entry in your `package.json`

---
### CI/CD
Deploy frontend project
```js
{
  "name": "hello-cicd-frontend",
  "main": "server/server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server/server.js",
    "dev": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "postinstall": "npm run build"
  }
}
```

---
### Let's talk CI
What we would like our integration service to do?
* Test
* Lint
* Build
* Integration Tasks and Tests



---
### Let's talk CI
Server side testing:
* Add testing using [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started.html)
* use our [jest-playground](https://github.com/webbeast2019/jest-playground) for jest refreshment

---
### Let's talk CI
Travis
* go to https://travis-ci.org/
* sign in with github, follow [these steps](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/#to-get-started-with-travis-ci)
* add .travis.yml

---
### Let's talk CI
CI => CD

We can provide CI output as CD input
* Make sure travis is working correctly
* Install Travis CLI
* Integrate Travis with heroku according to [the docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/heroku/)
* Disable Heroku auto-deployment (will be initiated by Heroku)
